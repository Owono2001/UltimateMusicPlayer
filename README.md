## ⚠️ Important Note on Deployment

This is a **desktop application** built with Python and a GUI toolkit (like Tkinter, PyQt, etc.). It is designed to run locally on a user's computer (Windows, macOS, Linux).

The web deployment snippet previously included (`Flask` code) is **not applicable** for converting this desktop application directly into a web application. Creating a web-based version would require a significant rewrite using web frameworks (like Flask, Django), web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and different approaches for audio handling/streaming suitable for a server-client model. Currently, web deployment is **not a feature** of this project.
